Session description:
--------------------

This session will explain the journey followed by the french insurance comparison website LesFurets.com to migrate from MySQL to Cassandra.
The session will use a sample application and replicate the patterns during a rocking live code session the whole path to go to Cassandra.
The team has fully open sourced their own framework which provides a 'domain model to key value mapping', a Cassandra schema generator and a CQL query builder on top of the Java driver.
Everything is relying on Java 8 streams and immutable data patterns.

The session will start by decorating a java beans data model with annotations to obtain a complete key value mapping.
Storing the key value model in cassandra with a strongly typed schema using the tooling of the framework.
Finally we will query the produced data with Spark in plain old SQL at the end of the session, fully live coded.

During a live code session we will show our migration path to Cassandra by using a sample application.
The team has open sourced their framework that provides: domain model to key value mapping, Cassandra schema generator and CQL query builder on top of the Java driver.
Everything is relying on Java 8 streams and immutable data patterns, and live in production with 20 M of comparisons per year.
